# Proposal

For my website proposal I’d like to create a website that congregates the best Pittsburgh food locales. One question many of us frequently ask ourselves is “Where do you want to eat?” This website would help answer that question. On the main page I would have the title at the top and on the left a drop-down menu. The drop-down menu would help with navigation of the site. The menu would include a home tab, a contact us tab, a weekly highlights tab, and maybe more. On the right side would be a “Quick Picks” section showcasing some of the most popular places people like to go. In the middle I would have multiple different buttons with different types of food labeled such as Japanese, Mexican, Brazilian, Upscale, breweries, etc. These tabs would then take you to their subject’s page and show you multiple different restaurants to choose from. Clicking on the image would then bring you to a more descriptive and in-depth review/analysis of the restaurant.
